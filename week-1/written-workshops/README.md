How the internet works:

Q1. What is localhost?

A1. Localhost refers to your own computer, it uses a name and IP address (127.0.0.1), that lets you run and test applications locally on a server that doesn't rely on the internet.

Q2. What are nameservers, why are they needed?

A2. Nameservers a part of the Domain Nmae System (DNS). They are servers that translate the domain name of a website (e.g. www.google.com) to the numerical IP address that compputers need to find the right server. They are important as they are fundamental for the functionality of the internet, and help with things such as traffic direction, and domain management.

Q3. Describe client and server: making a request, receiving a response.

A3. The client refers to the user, their computer and the user interface (UI) that they interact with. The server refers to the physical hardware and specialised software that directly responds to requests made by the client. The client makes requests (e.g. go to www.google.com) to the server, if the server has the information needed it makes a direct response to the client, if it doesn't have all information needed the server makes a request to a database asking for the data required, the database responds to the service with the data, allowing the server to correctly respond to the client's request.

Q4. What is a port? What's the default port?

A4. A port is a virtual location where a computer receives specific types of internet traffic. They come in the form of a number, and allow a computer to manage multiple internet services without mixing up any data. The default internet ports are 80 for unsecured web traffic (HTTP) and 443 for secured web traffic (HTTPS)
